# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is a real-time feeds of the earthquake data generated by [USGS.gov](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php). This dataset contains the infomation of earthquakes that happened in the past 30 days. 

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * Plot earthquakes on the world map to show:
   - If seismic activity majorly happen along the edge of tectonic plates?
   - Which part of the earth has the most seismic activity in the past 30 days?
 * Is there any correlation between the magnitude of earthquake and the depth of earthquake?
 * Are there any interesting patterns of the earthquakes at the region with the most seismic activity?
 * Make interactions such as:
   - Brushing (to select cirlces)
   - Zooming (to zoom in and zoom out on the map)
   - Dragging (to rotate the map)

)

How is the data visualized:

* Make a world map.
* Add tectonic plates boundries onto the world map.
* Use circles to represent the earthquakes. Plot the earthquakes on the world map according to its longitude and latitude.
* Circle sizes will be based on the value of magnitude of the earthquakes.
* Colors will be added to the circles to show the depth (or time) of the earthquake.

What are the interactions:

* Use tooltip to show infomation (including Magnitude, Location, and Depth) about each earthquake when hover on to the circle.
* Associate each circle(earthquake) with its own webpage(a url) at USGU.gov. By clicking the circle, users will be directed to the information page of this earthquake.
* Add brushing and zooming in this dataviz to select ceritan earthquakes on tha map. This will trigger a plot down below the map, which will illustrate the magnitudes and significances of the selected earthquakes.
  Users may use this tool to check if there are any intereting patterns among these seismic activities.
* Add dragging in this dataviz to rotate the world map.
* The legend and filter button are used to filter the depth and magnitude of the earthquakes.

## Prototypes

Iâ€™ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a world map with earthquakes plotted onto it.

A scattor plot of time vs magnitude. The color of the dots represent the depth of the earthquakes.

## Self-Critique and Reprioritization (Date: 04-10-2024)

I am quite satisfied with the map plot that I made. This map intuitively shows that the majority of the earthquakes were happened along the boundries of the plates. 
There are more earthquakes around the pacific ocean than the other places on earth. The region along the south coastline in Alaska and the west coast of America has the most seismic activities. These earthquakes are dominantly less than Magnitude of 2.5 (M2.5). Luckily, this is the level that won't cause damages and are not felt by human. Click and Check the [Earthquake Magnitude Scale](https://www.mtu.edu/geo/community/seismology/learn/earthquake-measure/magnitude/).

With my limited coding experience, I found it was quite difficult to add all the interactive features into the map plot as I proposed. And I found adding brush would compromise the function of tooltips and accessing the earthquake urls through clicking the circles. Moreover, adding drag to horizontically rotate the map made the zooming and panning become invalid. Thus, I have decided to eliminate brushing and zooming interactions from the design. This map plot has otherwise incorperated with all the rest of the proposed features.

Besides, though the weeks working with this project, I realized that a good data visualization does not necessarily have to be fancy, but it should be easy to understand. It is not an app or a tool, it does not have to include all kinds of interactions. I think the most important thing of data visualization is to deliver the information from the data. 






## Open Questions

* How to make a dual-axis chart with line chart and column chart in one chart using d3?
* How to add filter button to my dataviz?
* How to add a second plot in the same dataviz? Like the one in my sketch.


## Milestones (5 weeks to go)

Week 1:

* Add dragging to rotatet the angle of the map. ==> done
* Add colors to the circles. ==> done
* Use data from the API for the scatter plot.==> done

Week 2:

* Add tooltip on circles==> done
* Add zooming 

Week 3:

* Add brushing to select circles on map.
* Correlate brushing selected circles with the scattor plot.

Week 4:

* Finalize all the features in the dataviz.

Week 5:
