# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is a real-time feeds of the earthquake data generated by [USGS](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php). This dataset contains the data of earthquakes that happened on earth in the past 30 days.


## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * Plot earthquakes on the world map to show:
   - If seismic activity majorly happen along the edge of tectonic plates?
   - Which part of the earth has the most seismic activity in the past 30 days?
 * Is there any correlation between the magnitude of earthquake and the depth of earthquake?
 * Are there any interesting patterns of the earthquakes at the region with the most seismic activity?
 * Make interactions such as:
   - Brushing (to select cirlces)
   - Zooming (to zoom in and zoom out on the map)
   - Dragging (to rotate the map)
   
## Sketches

How is the data visualized:

* Make a world map.
* Add tectonic plates boundries onto the world map.
* Use circles to represent the earthquakes. Plot the earthquakes on the world map according to its longitude and latitude.
* Circle sizes will be based on the value of magnitude of the earthquakes.
* Colors will be added to the circles to show the depth (or time) of the earthquake.

What are the interactions:

* Use tooltip to show infomation (including Magnitude, Location, and Depth) about each earthquake when hover on to the circle.
* Associate each circle(earthquake) with its own webpage(a url) at USGU.gov. By clicking the circle, the user will be directed to the information page of this earthquake.
* Add brushing and zooming in this dataviz to select ceritan earthquakes on tha map. And make a line chart of the seleceted earthquakes to check if there are any intereting patterns.
* Add dragging in this dataviz to rotate the world map.

## Prototypes

I’ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a world map with earthquakes plotted onto it.

A scattor plot of time vs magnitude. The color of the dots represent the depth of the earthquakes.

## Open Questions

Previous questions:

* How to pull data from an API
* How to associate url with the cirlce in data viz
* How to rotate the angle of a 2D map

Thanks to Professor Kelleher. He helped me on solving the above questions.

More questions to add:
...

(describe any fear, uncertainty, or doubt you’re having about the feasibility of implementing the sketched system. For example, “I’m not sure where to get the geographic shapes to build a map from this data” or “I don’t know how to resolve the codes to meaningful names” … Feel free to delete this section if you’re confident.)

## Milestones (6 weeks to go)

Week 1:

Add dragging to rotatet the angle of the map.


Week 2:



Week 3:



Week 4:



Week 5:



Week 6:



(for each week, estimate what would be accomplised)
