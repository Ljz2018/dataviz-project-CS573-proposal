# Data Visualization Project - Earthquakes on Map

## Data

The data I use to visualize for my project is real-time feeds of earthquake data generated by [USGS.gov](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php). This dataset contains information on earthquakes that occurred in the past 7 days. On their website, there are also options to download data formed from the past hour up to the past 30 days.

The features from the dataset that I utilized for this project are:

| features | Description |
| --- | --- |
| mag | The magnitude for the event |
| depth | Depth of the event in kilometers |
| longitude | Decimal degrees longitude. Negative values for western longitudes |
| latitude | Decimal degrees latitude. Negative values for southern latitudes |
| time | Time when the event occurred |
| place | Textual description of named geographic region near to the event |
| url | Link to USGS Event Page for event |

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * Plot earthquakes on the world map to show the earthquakes location.
   - Do seismic activity majorly happen along the edge of tectonic plates?
   - Which part of the earth has the most seismic activity in the past 30 days?
 * Is there any correlation between the magnitude of earthquake and the depth of earthquake?
 * Are there any interesting patterns of the earthquakes at the region with the most seismic activity?
 * Make interactions such as:
   - Brushing (to select cirlces)
   - Zooming (to zoom in and zoom out on the map)
   - Dragging (to rotate the map)
   
## Sketches

)

How is the data visualized:

* Make a world map.
* Add tectonic plates boundries onto the world map.
* Use circles to represent the earthquakes. Plot the earthquakes on the world map according to its longitude and latitude.
* Circle sizes will be based on the value of magnitude of the earthquakes.
* Colors will be added to the circles to show the depth (or time) of the earthquake.

What are the interactions:

* Use tooltip to show infomation (including Magnitude, Location, and Depth) about each earthquake when hover on to the circle.
* Associate each circle(earthquake) with its own webpage(a url) at USGU.gov. By clicking the circle, users will be directed to the information page of this earthquake.
* Add brushing and zooming in this dataviz to select ceritan earthquakes on tha map. This will trigger a plot down below the map, which will illustrate the magnitudes and significances of the selected earthquakes.
  Users may use this tool to check if there are any intereting patterns among these seismic activities.
* Add dragging in this dataviz to rotate the world map.
* The legend and filter button are used to filter the depth and magnitude of the earthquakes.

## Prototypes

Iâ€™ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. 

1. A world map with earthquakes plotted onto it.

2. A scattor plot of time vs magnitude. The color of the dots represent the depth of the earthquakes.

## Earthquakes on Map 

From the prototype, I made some improvements and created an interactive map with bubbles to illustrate the earthquakes on the world map.

This map intuitively shows that the majority of the earthquakes occurred along the boundaries of the plates. There are more earthquakes around the Pacific Ocean than in other places on Earth. The region along the south coastline in Alaska and the west coast of America has the most seismic activity. These earthquakes are predominantly less than Magnitude 2.5 (M2.5). Luckily, this is a level that won't cause damage and is not felt by humans. Click and Check the [Earthquake Magnitude Scale](https://www.mtu.edu/geo/community/seismology/learn/earthquake-measure/magnitude/).

Interactions included:

* Zooming to enlarge the map
* Dropdown menus to filter the data
* Buttuns for rotating the map
* Linked url with each circle
* Added tooltip to each cirlce

## Linked Views of Earthquake Map and Magnitude Scatter Plot

I combined the map and the magnitude scatter plot onto one data visualization. These two data visualizations are linked with a brushing tool.

**1. Earthquakes Linked Views with Brushing on Scatter Plot** 

[![image](https://github.com/Ljz2018/dataviz-project-CS573-proposal/assets/139059537/b3bb6a67-199e-4a3c-97c3-f7ed82bd898e
)](https://vizhub.com/Ljz2018/14506278d7ae4a198f26e58123195f3d)

This data visualization allows users to select a time frame on the scatter plot and view the earthquakes that occurred within that time frame on the map. By dragging the brush across the x-scale, users can observe the dynamic changes in earthquake occurrences over time.

**2. Earthquakes Linked Views with Brushing on Map** 

[![image](https://github.com/Ljz2018/dataviz-project-CS573-proposal/assets/139059537/724305ec-e036-4a4d-8b01-ffc156a7bcf9
)](https://vizhub.com/Ljz2018/d37fd82778574054aeb1be33bd953a44)

This is an inversion of the first linked-view data visualization. Users can use the brush tool to select earthquakes on the map and plot the data on the scatter plot. 
By doing so, we can easily check the seismic activity at one focused spot.

## Future Steps

* In Earthquakes Linked Views with Brushing on Map:
  - resize the y-scale on the scatter plot when brushing tool is in use.
  - ideally change the scatter plot to a line chart.
* Make the x-scale of the scatter plot expandable.

## At the End

Thank you to Professor Kellerher and all the classmates who helped me with the progress on this project!
