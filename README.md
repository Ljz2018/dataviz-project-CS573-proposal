# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is a real-time feeds of the earthquake data generated by [USGS](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php). This dataset contains the data of earthquakes that happened on earth in the past 30 days.


## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * Plot earthquakes on the world map to show:
   - If seismic activity majorly happen along the edge of tectonic plates?
   - Which part of the earth has the most seismic activity in the past 30 days?
 * Is there any correlation between the magnitude of earthquake and the depth of earthquake?
 * Are there any interesting patterns of the earthquakes at the region with the most seismic activity?

## Sketches

(insert one or more hand-drawn sketches of interactive visualizations that you imagine)
(describe each sketch - how is the data visualized, what are the interactions, and how do these relate to the questions/tasks)


## Prototypes

I’ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a ... and it shows ...

(please put a screenshot of one or more visualizations of this dataset you already made, for previous assignments, and link to them)

You can put images into here by pasting them into issues.

You can make images into links like this:

## Open Questions

(describe any fear, uncertainty, or doubt you’re having about the feasibility of implementing the sketched system. For example, “I’m not sure where to get the geographic shapes to build a map from this data” or “I don’t know how to resolve the codes to meaningful names” … Feel free to delete this section if you’re confident.)

## Milestones

(for each week, estimate what would be accomplised)
